## ChatGPT suggestion:



To start, you and your friend could visit a local park or outdoor space and take note of the people present. You can observe if there are children, young adults, or older people, and if most people are in groups or alone. You may also try to make gendered observations, such as the ratio of men and women in the park, and see if the space is busy or quiet.

Next, you can look at the access to the outdoor space and observe the nearby homes. Ask yourself, who has the most immediate access to this outdoor space, and are there any factors that could limit access to certain groups?

Reflect on your experience and summarize what you observed in your Packback discussion post. Share your thoughts and feelings about the experience, and consider how this relates to the themes discussed in this week's learning materials. For example, you could consider how issues of representation and identity impact people's ability to access and enjoy outdoor spaces.

When replying to your peers, offer comparisons to your own research or experiences. Did you find anything that they did not, and are you surprised by their reactions to the information? This can help foster a meaningful conversation and further explore issues related to representation and identity in outdoor spaces.
