"I wandered lonely as a cloud, that floats on high over vales and hills"

--- William Wordsworth(1807)

> Wordsworth, W. (1807). *I wandered lonely as a cloud*. In Poems in Two Volumes (Vol. 1, pp. 328-329). Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown.

我曾经在深圳河畔的南花村里度过了快乐的童年时光。虽然身处中国发展最快的城市的腹地，那的景色依然是如此宁静。在我的记忆里，美好的她远离城市喧嚣和污染，每当我在郁郁葱葱的草地上奔跑，我都会感到无比的喜悦和自由。蝉鸣和麻雀叽叽喳喳的声音，伴随着微风吹过树林，深深地印在我的脑海里。每当夕阳西下的时候，从我家靠近深圳河旁的阳台望去，河畔的芦苇和对岸的香港田野构成了一幅美丽的画卷，让人陶醉。而在我心中，最美好的回忆就是那座小公园了，在这里度过的每一个夏日和秋天都充满了快乐和美好的回忆。

小公园距离我的家只有短短的500米，每天上下学都要经过它。那时候，我和我的小伙伴们经常在那里嬉戏玩耍，从老鹰捉小鸡到捉迷藏，公园到处都是我们欢快的踪迹。公园里有各种各样的健身器材，比如沙地、爬杆，还有适合老年人使用的健身器械。四周环绕着郁郁葱葱的大树，空气中弥漫着青草和花朵的香气，仿佛整个公园都是一片绿意盎然的海洋。我们在公园里尽情地奔跑、翻滚、攀爬，享受着自由和快乐。

然而，随着时间的推移，小公园里的人渐渐变少了，我的小村子也被视为城市落后的“城中村”，被迫进行了拆除重建。如今，多年过去了，当去年我重回家乡时，看到曾经的小村子已经被夷平成一片沙地，我的心情十分沉重。我不禁想起了那座曾经让我如此快乐的小公园，我在想：未来建设起来的社区，还会有那么美好、生机盎然、老少皆宜的公园吗？

现在，我身处异国他乡，但是我依然怀念那片深圳河畔的田园风光。即使在遥远的国度，我也可以感受到那里的美好和自然之美。每当我想起那片青葱的草地和绿色的林荫道，我就感到自己与家乡仍然紧密相连，这份情感也让我倍感珍贵。

I once spent a happy childhood in Nanhua Village on the bank of the Shenzhen River. Despite being in the hinterland of the fastest-growing city in China, the scenery there was still so peaceful. In my memory, it was far from the hustle and bustle and pollution of the city, and every time I ran on the lush green grass, I felt immense joy and freedom. The sounds of cicadas and sparrows chirping, accompanied by the breeze blowing through the woods, were deeply imprinted in my mind. Every time the sun went down, looking from the balcony of my home near the Shenzhen River, the reeds on the riverbank and the Hong Kong fields on the opposite bank formed a beautiful picture that was intoxicating. And in my heart, the happiest memory was that small park, where every summer and autumn spent there was full of happy and beautiful memories.

The small park was only 500 meters away from my home, and we had to pass by it every day on our way to and from school. At that time, my friends and I often played there, from catching the small chickens to playing hide-and-seek. The park was full of our happy footprints. There were various fitness equipment in the park, such as sand, climbing poles, and fitness equipment suitable for the elderly. Surrounded by lush trees, the air was filled with the fragrance of grass and flowers, as if the entire park was a green ocean. We ran, rolled, and climbed freely and happily in the park, enjoying our freedom and happiness.

However, with the passage of time, fewer and fewer people were in the small park, and my small village was also regarded as a "village in the city" that was backward and was forced to be demolished and rebuilt. Now, many years have passed. When I returned to my hometown last year and saw that the small village had been leveled into a sandy land, I felt very heavy-hearted. I couldn't help but think of that small park that had once made me so happy. I wondered, would the future communities that were built still have such a beautiful, vibrant, and all-ages-friendly park?

Now, I am living in a foreign country, but I still miss the rural scenery on the banks of the Shenzhen River. Even in a distant land, I can still feel the beauty and natural beauty there. Every time I think of the lush green grass and green tree-lined paths, I feel that I am still closely connected to my hometown, and this emotion also makes me feel precious.

**I. Introduction**

**A. Explanation of the purpose of the Environmental Autobiography**

**B. Definition of childhood landscapes and their impact on values**

**C. Explanation of the assignment requirements**

学习RST242之后，我对自然和美国文化的理解大大加深了。自然对个人成长有极大的影响，无论身处芝加哥那样的钢筋水泥丛林，还是出身于亚马逊的热带雨林，童年时代给予我们最大震撼的，往往是庞大的世界本身。在这篇环境自传里，我将以历史和文化的视角去分析我的童年记忆，回忆并辨析我小时候对世界的印象，以环保主义和现代主义的知识去剖析背后的文化，性别，种族等因素。作为一名中国人，课程所学习的美国文化因素或许不完全适用于我，但是我可以提取其中的共同点，试图给你展现我心中最初最纯粹的美好自然风光：我故乡的一座小公园。

After studying RST242, my understanding of nature and American culture has deepened significantly. Nature has a profound impact on personal growth, whether one is in the concrete jungle of Chicago or grew up in the tropical rainforests of the Amazon. Often, what gives us the greatest shock in childhood is the vastness of the world itself. In this environmental autobiography, I will analyze my childhood memories from a historical and cultural perspective, recalling and analyzing my impressions of the world as a child, while also examining the cultural, gender, and racial factors behind these impressions through the lens of environmentalism and modernism. As a Chinese person, the American cultural factors learned in the course may not be entirely applicable to me, but I can extract the commonalities and attempt to show you the most pure and beautiful natural scenery in my heart: a small park in my hometown.

**C. Subjective description of the environment**

I spent a happy childhood in Nanhua Village on the bank of the Shenzhen River. Despite being in the center of the fastest-growing city in China, the scenery there was still so peaceful.

Every time the sun went down, looking from the balcony of my home near the Shenzhen River, the reeds on the riverbank and the Hong Kong fields on the opposite bank formed a beautiful picture that was intoxicating. And in my heart, the happiest memory was that small park besides my primary school, where every summer and autumn spent there was full of happy and beautiful memories.



> Holding the initial impression of nature, the little park taught me what is curiosity, the wonder of life and the urgent need of nature preservation. It was only 500 meters away from my home, and we had to pass by it every day on our way to and from school. At that time, my friends and I often played there, from catching the small chickens to playing hide-and-seek. The park was full of our happy footprints.

Holding the initial impression of nature, the little park taught me what is curiosity, the wonder of life and the urgent need of nature preservation. 

According to Rocheleau, Thomas-Slayter, and Wangari (1996), nature is not only a source of beauty and inspiration, but also a necessity for survival, and this park helped me to realize the urgent need of nature preservation. It was only 500 meters away from my home, and we had to pass by it every day on our way to and from school. At that time, my friends and I often played there, from catching the small chickens to playing hide-and-seek. The park was full of our happy footprints. According to Nash (2014), this type of interaction with nature is important for fostering a sense of curiosity and wonder about the natural world. There was various fitness equipment in the park, such as sand, climbing poles, and fitness equipment suitable for the elderly. According to Xiao, Lee, and Larson (2022), parks that offer a diverse range of activities and amenities, such as fitness equipment, are more likely to attract a diverse range of visitors. Surrounded by lush trees, the air was filled with the fragrance of grass and flowers, as if the entire park was a green ocean. We ran, rolled, and climbed freely and happily in the park, enjoying our freedom and happiness.

However, with the passage of time, fewer and fewer people were in the small park, and my small village was also regarded as a "village in the city" that was backward and was forced to be demolished and rebuilt. According to Rowland-Shea, Doshi, Edberg, and Fanger (2020), racial and economic disparities can lead to the destruction of natural areas, and this destruction can disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Now, many years have passed. When I returned to my hometown last year and saw that the small village had been leveled into a sandy land, I felt very heavy-hearted. I couldn't help but think of that small park that had once made me so happy. I wondered, would the future community that were built still have such a beautiful, vibrant, and all-ages-friendly park?



As a child, the little park near my home taught me the importance of nature preservation and fostered my sense of curiosity and wonder about the natural world. Rocheleau, Thomas-Slayter, and Wangari (1996) emphasize that nature is not only a source of beauty and inspiration, but also a necessity for survival. Nash (2014) further supports this idea, stating that interactions with nature can inspire a sense of curiosity and wonder about the natural world. The park offered a diverse range of activities and amenities, such as fitness equipment suitable for people of all ages. According to Xiao, Lee, and Larson (2022), parks that offer a diverse range of activities and amenities are more likely to attract a diverse range of visitors.



值得指出的是，中国的社区公园同样有社会不平等的影响。小公园对我来说是一个安全而熟悉的地方，我在那里感到很舒服。然而，并不是每个人都有这种奢侈，比方说我很少看见有女生会出门和我们一同玩耍。我还记得，曾经有一个比我年长的小姐姐和我们玩了很久捉迷藏，回家后被父母狠狠呵斥了。同时，经济压力也是一项重要因素，例如家境不太好的同学也经常被迫在自家的小卖部看守店铺，而没有时间在公园里放松。值得指出的是，这些现象是极为普遍的，亚文化可以影响人们如何看待他们与户外的关系。例如，住在芝加哥市中心的人如果不能接触到附近的绿地，就很难经常接触大自然。同时，残疾人可能会面临进入室外空间的挑战，这些室外空间不是根据他们的需求设计的。我家附近的小公园没有配备适合残疾人的设施，没有盲文，也没有轮椅可以进入的斜坡。



- Understand the role of gender in the environment.
- Identify the major types of feminist perspectives on the environment.
- Understand feminist critiques of environmental discourses and natural resources management in contemporary American culture.
- Explain current and past feminist social movements and their impact on environmental politics and American society.
- Continue developing your own personal values and views towards nature, natural landscapes, and land management perspectives.

Using the idea of feminist and subculture, optimize the following paragraph without changing its meaning, with citation from the book list:

The impact of community parks in China is influenced by social inequalities, including gender and economic pressures. Gottlieb (2005) notes that gender is an important factor in understanding environmentalism, and Rocheleau et al. (1996) argue that feminist political perspectives offer a valuable framework for analyzing these inequalities. Feminist critiques, as discussed by both Rothman (2000) and Nash (2014), highlight the limitations of traditional environmental discourses and resource management practices, particularly in their exclusion of marginalized groups. The subculture that a person belongs to can also shape their relationship with nature and outdoor spaces, as noted by Rowland-Shea et al. (2020) in their discussion of the nature gap in America. It is important to recognize that these social and cultural factors impact access to and use of outdoor spaces, including parks. Furthermore, as Xiao et al. (2022) suggest, understanding the constraints and preferences of diverse populations is crucial for promoting equitable access to and use of natural landscapes.

"It is worth noting that community parks in China also have a social inequality impact. The little park was a safe and familiar place for me, and I felt comfortable there. However, not everyone has this luxury. For example, I rarely saw girls go out to play with us. I remember playing hide-and-seek for a long time with an older sister, but she was scolded harshly by her parents when she got home. Meanwhile, Economic pressure is also an important factor. For example, classmates from less wealthy families are often forced to look after the family's small shop and do not have time to relax in the park. It should be emphasized that these phenomena are extremely common, and subcultures can influence how people perceive their relationship with the outdoors. For example, a person living in the center of Chicago may have a hard time accessing nature regularly if they cannot reach nearby green spaces. At the same time, people with disabilities may face challenges entering outdoor spaces that are not designed to meet their needs. The small park near my home was not equipped with facilities suitable for people with disabilities, such as braille and wheelchair-accessible ramps."

By acknowledging the influence of subcultures, we can recognize the impact of social inequality on access to nature. For instance, in China, economic pressures and gender norms can create barriers to outdoor recreation for some individuals. Girls may be discouraged from participating in outdoor activities, and less affluent families may not have the resources to prioritize leisure time in community parks. Additionally, people with disabilities may struggle to access outdoor spaces that lack necessary accommodations. It is important to understand these social dynamics and their implications for environmental justice, as they shape how different groups of people relate to and experience nature.

# end

Sadly, with the passage of time, the park became less frequented, and my small village was forced to be demolished and rebuilt. Rowland-Shea, Doshi, Edberg, and Fanger (2020) explain that racial and economic disparities can lead to the destruction of natural areas, which disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Today, the small village where the park once stood is now a sandy land, and I wonder if the future community that was built in its place will have a similarly beautiful, vibrant, and all-ages-friendly park.
