**DISCUSSION #6 PROMPT:**

Review a map of your childhood neighborhood to determine how many public parks are within walking distance of your home.

Your discussion should describe the following:

- How many parks are within walking distance of your home?
  - 1.5 
- Did you visit these parks often, did you travel further to visit public parks, or did you rarely spend time at public parks?
  - Almost everyday
  - Yes, 红树林公园 mostly， 一周一次
- Does the park closest to your house have any human-made features, such as pavilions, playgrounds, or basketball courts?
  - 沙地爬杆，健身器械，大树
  - 平滑的混凝土地面，适合滑滑板
  - 曾经是沙地，后来改建成胶版地面
- What was this park primarily used for in your hometown?
  - 老人小孩活动玩耍



我在中国城市化的前沿，深圳。我很幸运，能在一个深圳河旁的小村子里长大。 这里贴近自然，有各种城市里难以见到的虫鱼鸟兽。而童年的我所最热爱的，是村镇中心的那座小公园。他离我家大概只有500米，每天我上下小学都会经过他。 我和我的同学们经常在其中各种各样的健身器材之间嬉戏，比方说爬上大树，在护栏之间钻来钻去。小公园麻雀虽小五脏俱全，有供小孩子玩耍的沙地和爬杆，适合老年人使用的健身器械，更重要的是四周布满都布满了绿意盎然的大树。公园里平滑的混凝土地面很适合滑滑板，不过这个地面发生过很多次改变，比方说曾经是沙地，后来改建成胶版地面。小时候的我不懂，很高兴熟悉的玩耍地点可以经常更新。现在想来，应该是社区的维护公司在翻修吧。

但长大后，我发现小公园里的人逐渐变少了，而最后，我的小村子被视为落后的“城中村”，进行了拆除重建。多年过去，我重回家乡，在人行天桥上看着被夷平成沙地的村，我在想：未来建设起来的社区，还会有那么生机盎然，欢声笑语，老少皆宜的公园吗？



I am born at the forefront of urbanization in China, in Shenzhen. I am fortunate to have grown up in a small village next to the Shenzhen River. Here, it is close to nature, with all kinds of insects, fish, birds, and animals that are hard to see in the urban city. And what I loved most in my childhood was the small park in the center of the village. It was only about 500 meters away from my house, and I passed by it every day on my way to and from primary school. My classmates and I often played among the various fitness equipment, for example, climbing trees and crawling between the fences. Although the small park was small, it had everything, such as a sandy area and climbing poles for children to play, fitness equipment for the elderly to use, and, most importantly, the surrounding area was full of lush trees. The smooth concrete ground in the park is very suitable for skateboarding, but this ground has undergone many changes. For example, it used to be a sandy area, and later, it was rebuilt as a rubber ground. When I was young, I didn't understand it, but I was very happy that the familiar place for playing could be updated frequently. Looking back now, it should be the community maintenance company that was renovating it.

However, as I grew up, I found that fewer and fewer people went to the small park, and finally, my small village was regarded as a backward "urban village" and was demolished and rebuilt. Many years have passed, and I have returned to my hometown. Standing on a pedestrian overpass and looking at the village that has been flattened into a sandy area, I am thinking: in the future, will the communities that are built still have such lively, cheerful, and suitable parks for people of all ages?



Your personal story highlights the importance of nature and outdoor spaces in childhood memories. It's unfortunate that the urbanization of your hometown led to the loss of the small park that you loved so much. Your experience reflects a broader trend of the loss of green spaces and nature in urban areas.

The gendered perspectives of nature are also relevant here. Rocheleau et al (1996) and Gottlieb (2005) describe nature as a male preserve, with men traditionally seen as the primary explorers and conquerors of the outdoors. However, your experience shows that nature and outdoor spaces can be equally important to people of all genders and ages. It's essential to challenge these gendered stereotypes and make outdoor spaces accessible and welcoming to everyone.

One of the major schools of feminist scholarship and activism is ecofeminism, which aims to address the intersections of gender, race, and class in environmental issues. Ecofeminists argue that the exploitation and degradation of nature are interconnected with the subjugation and oppression of women and marginalized communities. They call for a more holistic and inclusive approach to environmentalism that recognizes the importance of diverse perspectives and experiences.

In your personal life, you associate nature and outdoor spaces with your childhood memories and the small park in your village. It's interesting to consider how different experiences and identities shape our relationship with nature. For example, some people may associate nature with adventure and risk-taking, while others may see it as a source of peace and tranquility.

The broader gendered representations of nature and outdoor spaces can have a significant impact on society's understanding of the outdoors. By challenging stereotypes and creating more inclusive and accessible outdoor spaces, we can promote a more diverse and equitable vision of environmentalism.

Based on my personal story, reply this post: Are parks that important? I was raised in Mongolia and there were no parks within short walking distance. The only one I can remember is the one in by the school, but everyone either got a ride or took a bus with a fee. And at school, we barely went to the park. It was more for if you got to school early. Kids spent a lot more time just by the street or in my case since my grandparents owned land within a fenced area, I played with my friends there. We rode bikes mainly but also bounced basketball or kicked it since there were no nets. My friends would come over and we generally ran around or something along that nature. The parks in America have so much more and bigger manmade playgrounds. 



I agree with you that parks are not only important for physical health but also for mental health. It's great to hear that you have access to two parks near your home, and that you take advantage of them to unwind after a day of studying. I think one thing about parks is that they offer a variety of experiences, from quiet walks among nature to more active pursuits like playing basketball.

In addition to providing a space to relax and exercise, parks can also offer opportunities for learning and exploration. For example, visitors can observe and learn about different plant and animal species, and some parks offer educational programs or guided tours. Parks can also be great places to connect with other members of the community, whether it's through organized events or simply by enjoying the same outdoor space. Overall, I think parks have a lot to offer and it's important to make time to visit and explore them.



1. Your Packback discussion post should summarize your research. What did you find? What do you remember? We are thinking about issues of access this week. Did you know anything about this issue before this week? Did what you find align with what you previously thought?

- Think about the themes from this week's learning materials to help you reflect on your experience and contribute to a meaningful conversation with your peers.
- When replying to your peers, offer comparisons to your own research. Did they find anything you did not? Are you surprised by their reaction to this information?
